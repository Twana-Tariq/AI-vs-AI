# AI-vs-AI
Building an Intelligent Detecter Against “Made Up” Content
With the continuous evolution of Artificial Intelligence, distinguishing between real and AI generated content has been a challenge. This project has a detection system with the capability of distinguishing whether a certain image, audio, video, or a live broadcast has been altered or generated by AI.

## Goal
We aim to develop a system that can flag a wide range of content such as image, audio, video, and live broadcasts. We also intend on making our system scalable to ensure we can keep up with AI’s evolution.
